# simple_stocks

A simple mobile application, written with Flutter, to show and search the stock price of a given company. It also shows a graph of the stocks past 6 months. 

The API used in this app is the Alpha Vantage Stock API (https://www.alphavantage.co/)
## Quick Note
The Alpha Vantage Stock API only allows up to 5 API calls per minute, for a free API key. Anything past the 5 calls per minute, costs a monthly fee, which is why this app is not available on either the Google Play Store or the Apple App Store
